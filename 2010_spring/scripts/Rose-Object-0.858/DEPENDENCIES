## WARNING: You are missing Rose::DateTime
##
## There is a circular dependency between Rose::Object and Rose::DateTime.
## Rose::Object will simply skip all tests that require Rose::DateTime, but
## you should really re-run "make test" after installing Rose::DateTime
## just to make sure everything works correctly.
